Starting Tues August 15, 2023 - I will track my progress for the [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).

R1D1: Aug 15. Trained on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/min-dles_/completed_solutions) for 5 kyu 'Calculating with Functions' and 6 kyu 'Does my number look big in this?'. Attended [Citrine meetup](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15SH0JMGRrjif32M53CBCwyulkIl03d8bDZ56ZzA3n0E/edit#gid=201164893) and confirmed plans to study TypeScript and Oop before next meetup on Aug 29th. Worked with Leila on coding practice & reviewed Render.com deploy docs with them.

R1D2: Aug 16. Refactored 6 kyu 'Does my number look big in this?' with exponentiation instead of Math.pow(). Completed first iteration of gradient fix on Gyst Rewind project.

R1D3: Aug 17. Added two posts to Gyst Rewind project. Updating my study repo to include 100 Days of Code documentation using mdx files. More Codewars training.

R1D4: Aug 18. Worked on 6 kyu 'Detect Panagram' for Codewars. Today was tough to fit in the hour of code because of a road trip, but I'm glad I got it done!
