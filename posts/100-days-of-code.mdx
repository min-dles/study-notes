Starting Tues August 15, 2023 - I will track my progress for the [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).

R1D1: Aug 15. Trained on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/min-dles_/completed_solutions) for 5 kyu 'Calculating with Functions' and 6 kyu 'Does my number look big in this?'. Attended [Citrine meetup](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15SH0JMGRrjif32M53CBCwyulkIl03d8bDZ56ZzA3n0E/edit#gid=201164893) and confirmed plans to study TypeScript and Oop before next meetup on Aug 29th. Worked with Leila on coding practice & reviewed Render.com deploy docs with them.

R1D2: Aug 16. Refactored 6 kyu 'Does my number look big in this?' with exponentiation instead of Math.pow(). Completed first iteration of gradient fix on Gyst Rewind project.

R1D3: Aug 17. Added two posts to Gyst Rewind project. Updating my study repo to include 100 Days of Code documentation using mdx files. More Codewars training.

R1D4: Aug 18. Worked on 6 kyu 'Detect Panagram' for Codewars. Today was tough to fit in the hour of code because of a road trip, but I'm glad I got it done! 

R1D5: Aug 19. Worked on 6 kyu 'Split Strings' for Codewars. Still on the road trip so today was also limited in time spent coding, and scheduled consult with client for next steps on Gyst Rewind project (scheduled Tues Aug 22).

R1D6: Aug 21. Worked on navigation and importing Gyst Rewind logo in preparation for client meeting tmrw. Started working on 5 kyu 'The Hashtag Generator' in Codewars.

R1D7: Aug 22. Coworking collaboration today with Leila, Vang, and Keegan; discussed Codewars problems and Angular, Oop, and TypeScript. Client meeting for Gyst Rewind went well and next steps identified; also resolved some merge conflicts for Gyst Rewind. Registered for AIR.

R1D8: Aug 23. Applied for a job today. Worked on Codewars problem some more and studies Regex.

R1D9: Aug 29. Took a break over the weekend for a trip to Utah and attended "Mind the Gap Fest". Today was my first day back to coding and I met up with the Citrine Cohort to discuss job search, and met up with Leila for a study session. Worked on my application to the Engineering Development Program offered through Travelers. 

R1D10: Aug 30. Attended "Career Talks" virtual job fair hosted by Out in Tech; I learned more about CrowdStrike's career path and connected with two of their recruiters on LinkedIn, and also checked out Honeywell's career path. Submitted my application for EDP, and spent some time refactoring my solo project for responsive web design of the mobile view (just for logged out users; need to continue working on this).

R1D11: Aug 31. Had another study session with Leila today and updated my resume and cover letter to be more streamlined. Applied to Media Junction after hearing that it is a queer-friendly workplace. Also, reached out to a couple Prime alumni to set up zoom meetings sometime. 

R1D12: Sept 1. Took pics to update professional photos on all platforms (LinkedIn, Slack, GitHub, freeCodeCamp, etc).

R1D13: Sept 2. Updated my 100DaysOfCode blog and started C# course on freeCodeCamp and Microsoft Learn.

R1D14: Sept 4. Studied Microsoft Learning x freeCodeCamp professional certification course being offered for C# language and .NET framework.

R1D15: Sept 5. Met with a mentor to discuss the job search today; he advised that I spend more time studying Java and getting great with it before applying to back-end roles. Also met up with Leila and Ilyas from my cohort to discuss job search; prepared for AIR 2023 by signing into the learning portal. Tmrw I will attend the Developer Training for AIR. Also signed up for LeetCode today, and worked on C# training some more. 

R1D16: Sept 6. Attended day one Developer Training for AIR. Completed more C# training through Microsoft Learning x freeCodeCamp. Also forked repo from Prime about C# and .NET assignment to prep that additional practice. Also recvd a couple interview prep resources from Climb mentor.

R1D17: Sept 7. Applied to US Bank Software Dev (Java / SpringBoot) position today, studied more C# through the module on Microsoft Learn, and attended Tech on Tap (networking event, discussed the importance of studying up fundamentals of algorithms and data structures for leetcode and interview practice; also learned about security operations as a future career path).

R1D18: Sept 8. Met with two Prime grads who have been in the tech field a few years now working, and loving what they do. Got some great advise about the job search, and recommended tooling to check out (Docker, AWS, Fin Tech, Kafka, and more) for backend development. Also updated GitHub "about me" section per advise from one of these meetings!

R1D19: Sept 9. Started working with MERN stack and signed up for MongoDB to create a Bookstore app from a freeCodeCamp tutorial; got stuck on local environment variables (.env) for the URI element. Goal is for this project to be hosted on GitHub so it can be viewed by others, but I can't do that with secure info in the code pushed to GitHub. 

R1D20: Sept 10. Learned who my team for AIR is going to be today! We are figuring out how we will keep in touch during this Hackathon (probably WhatsApp). Also discussed some pseudocode with my partner, specifically gradients and scoping for her portfolio. 

R1D21: Sept 11. Today was a busy dev day! Lots of prep and coordination with teammates for AIR; we are going to be the TeA11y Penguins, I think! The kickoff event was today and our team got paired with client The Iris Project. We will be working with Drupal (a CMS). Additionally I had a great day with coding projects as I *finally* got the local environment variables connected in my MERN bookstore project (.env) and was able to push several commits!
